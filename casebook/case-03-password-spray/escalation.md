# Escalation Notes (Tier‑1 → Tier‑2)

## Summary
Alert suggests suspicious activity consistent with the case scenario. Tier‑1 validated baseline deviations and collected initial evidence. Recommend Tier‑2 deep dive and any necessary containment.

## Evidence package
- Timeline
- Entities (user/host/IP/app)
- Query snippets used
- Any extracted IOCs

## Suggested Tier‑2 next steps
- Validate impact (did data leave? did the actor succeed?)
- Expand scope (other users/hosts involved?)
- Containment recommendations (session revoke, endpoint isolate, mailbox cleanup)
- Root cause analysis and prevention controls
